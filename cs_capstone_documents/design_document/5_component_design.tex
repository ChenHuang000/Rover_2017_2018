% \subsection{Graphical Interfacing System}
% Not so sure about this section..... Needs to be molded into what the rest look like
% \subsubsection{Overview}
% The Graphical Interfacing System is of particular importance to this project.
% Information from the rover must be quickly, efficiently, and accurately displayed to the user.
% The rover will generage large amounts of information in real time that is vital to the success of the operator during the competition.
% Furthermore, options must be presented to the user that alow rover functionality to be modified on the fly.
% Without quick and accurate feedback, the operator will be unable to successfully compete in the challenge. 
% \subsubsection{Design Concerns}
% The GUI is what the user uses to abstract the underlying software package into a black box for ease of use. 
% The GUI will show values and display video from the rover. 
% The GUI will not allow the user to go through the package while in use.
% \subsubsection{Design Elements}
% The GUI will use a framework called Qt, which is named for the company by the same name. 
% This system will take care of any video streams that the rover may have. 
% The GUI will also visually display values of sensors that are on the rover. 
% The GUI will show any status using indicators to show any errors for new information for the user to see.
% The GUI will also translate any information that is hard to visualize data into real life representations of sensors like the IMU. 
% All of these can be done mostly the GUI itself, and other things will be run with OpenGL code or embedded programs like some ROS packages.
% \subsubsection{Design Rationale}
% Without a system that simplifies use of the software, the re-usability of the software decreases and does not meet requirements. 
% The GUI also feeds information to the team that is necessary for competition.
