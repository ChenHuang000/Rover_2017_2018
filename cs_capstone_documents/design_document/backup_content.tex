\subsection{Mapping System}
\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
The mapping system that will be included in our GUI will be displaying a map of the terrain and location of our rover.
The mapping must allow for a way-point like system that can be used as guiding points.
The way-points need to be added by clicking on a map, or entering in a GPS location in the software.
The way-points need to be editable, and deletable.
The rover needs to be able to take the way-points on the software and then translate them into actual locations.
\subsubsection{Design Elements}
The system will be based around rvis, a package in ROS, that can display an image on a screen.
The system takes in an image and a GPS location and then the package will return an image and line path of the rover.
The system gets the package off of Github and then compiles it on the system.
The system might need extra logic that is not present in rvis and can be written in Python or C to make the package work.
\subsubsection{Design Rationale}
Talk about why the system should be designed the way described
